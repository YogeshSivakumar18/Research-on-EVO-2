# EVO 2: Ethical, Risk, and Governance Assessment of an AI Genomics Model

## Overview

This repository contains a critical academic assessment of **EVO 2**, an advanced AI model developed for genomic analysis by the Arc Institute, NVIDIA, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, and UCSF. Rather than focusing on implementation or training of the model, this research evaluates EVO 2 through the lenses of **risk**, **ethics**, and **governance** with particular attention to privacy, informed consent, algorithmic bias, and international policy implications.

EVO 2 is notable for processing genomic sequences up to 1 million base pairs and predicting gene function and mutational effects with high accuracy. Its deployment at scale raises important questions about responsible AI use in sensitive biomedical contexts.

## Focus Areas

### 1. **Risk Assessment**
- Data privacy and protection of individual genetic information
- Risks of unintended genetic modifications in clinical or experimental applications
- Potential for misuse in unsupervised or commercial settings

### 2. **Ethical Considerations**
- The necessity of informed consent and autonomy in genomic data use
- Exclusion of human-infecting pathogen sequences from training
- Equity and bias mitigation in model predictions

### 3. **Governance and Policy**
- Proposals for ethical frameworks and global regulation
- Governance models guided by public values and transparency
- Reference to GDPR-aligned and EU-derived legislative benchmarks

## Deliverables

- **Research Report**: Comprehensive analysis document with citations  
- **Reference List**: Peer-reviewed articles and technical documentation  
- **Figure**: Visual diagram of EVO 2's data pipeline and training stages
