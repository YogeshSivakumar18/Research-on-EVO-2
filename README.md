# EVO 2: A Critical Analysis of AI-Driven Genomics Through its Data Pipeline

## Overview

This repository presents an academic research project that offers a **comprehensive assessment of EVO 2**, a state-of-the-art AI model developed for genomic analysis. The study investigates EVO 2 by thoroughly examining its **data pipeline architecture**, revealing how its structure, training processes, and data handling strategies give rise to broader concerns about **risk, ethics, and governance** in AI-driven genomics.

EVO 2 was developed in collaboration between the Arc Institute, NVIDIA, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and UCSF. Capable of processing genomic sequences up to 1 million base pairs, EVO 2 utilizes a novel architecture (StripedHyena 2) and was trained on a massive OpenGenome2 dataset containing over 9.3 trillion nucleotides.

## Core Focus

This project does **not** aim to build or extend EVO 2, but instead to critically assess the **implications of its data pipeline**, including:

### Pipeline-Based Risk Assessment
- Data quality controls and privacy protections
- Risks of genetic misuse or unintended consequences in genome editing
- Bias inheritance from organismal diversity in the training data

### Ethical Evaluation
- Informed consent in genomic data collection and use
- Transparency in excluded pathogen data and its impact on research access
- Fair use and equitable treatment in predictions and applications

### Governance and Policy Implications
- International regulation needs and ethical frameworks
- Public accountability and legal alignment (e.g., GDPR, EU Bioethics)
- Real-time oversight of AI systems in biomedical research
